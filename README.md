### fyi
have to make another one because the [previous portfolio](https://archangel-12.vercel.app/) is kind of ugly, and i actually plan to terminate that thing

### p.s
in order to stay trasnparent, this new portfolio of mine was actually inspired by this [repo](https://github.com/Joscriptt/portfolioblog). huge credit goes to that guy. so yeah, there is no originality in this new one...

n i thought, javascript is bad :/

yeah i think that's about it...
