### some notes...
- this new portfolio heavily uses tailwind.css. always read the documentation, or else you'll get confused and have no idea what to type

- if u actually want to clone that guy [repo](https://github.com/Joscriptt/portfolioblog) (not this one), feel free to do so. but if I were you, i would rather just upgrade to the newest one as soon as I clone his

- it was a mistake to install that ``editor.js`` on ``package.json``. should've just:
```json
 "dependencies": {
    "@react-email/button": "0.0.11",
    "@react-email/components": "^0.0.6",
    "@react-email/html": "0.0.6",
    "@tailwindcss/container-queries": "^0.1.1",
    "classnames": "^2.3.2",
    "framer-motion": "^10.16.4",
    "next": "latest",
    "next-themes": "^0.2.1",
    "react": "latest",
    "react-dom": "latest",
    "react-email": "^1.9.3",
    "react-icons": "^4.11.0",
    "resend": "^0.15.3"
 }
 ```
yeah, only that

- i think that's it...
